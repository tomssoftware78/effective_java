of()
   Use Stream.of() to create a Stream from similar type of data

   Stream<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).stream()
      can become
   Stream<Integer> numbers = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

iterate()
   Generate an infinite sequential Ordered Stream produced by iterative application of the provided UnaryOperator.
   The seed is the initial element of the iteration.

   Stream.iterate(0, i -> i + 2).limit(10); //generates a stream of even numbers and returns first 10 elements

generate()
   Gerenate an infinite sequential unordered stream where each element is generated by the provided Supplier

   Stream.generate(new Random()::nextInt).limit(10); //generates a stream of random numbers and returns first 5 elements
