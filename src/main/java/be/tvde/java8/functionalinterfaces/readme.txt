Functional interface = an interface that contains only a single abstract method which is
   unimplemented

Functional interface can contain default and static methods which do have an implementation, in
   addition to the single unimplemented method

Some of the useful Java 8 functional interfaces:
   Consumer       DoubleConsumer, IntConsumer, LongConsumer, BiConsumer
   Supplier       IntSupplier, DoubleSupplier, LongSupplier
   Function       BiFunction, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator
   Predicate      IntPredicate, DoublePredicate, LongPredicate, BiPredicate
