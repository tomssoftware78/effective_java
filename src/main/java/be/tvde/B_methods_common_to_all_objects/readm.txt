Object is a concrete class, but is mainly created for extension.
All its nonfinal methods (  equals  ) have explicit general CONTRACTS
                            hashCode
                            toString
                            finalize

Classes overriding these methods have the responsibility to obey these contracts.
Functioning of other classes(ex. HashMap, HashSet, ...) depends on these contracts!
